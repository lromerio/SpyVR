Comments and suggestions welcome!


Easy and quick to set up ways to interact with your VR creations. In this kit are VR levers and VR buttons. They come as physics based or grip based versions.

Gripped levers respond to the player grabbing and moving it with a tracked motion controller. 

Physics levers and buttons can be pressed by physics objects (e.g. you could throw a ball to press a button).
The levers and buttons use UI style event listeners so it's easy to create a "physical" UI. 

Requires the Steam VR plugin and is intended for use with tracked motion controllers.
